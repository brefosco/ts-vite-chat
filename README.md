# Prototype Chat Application

Prototype of a real-time chat application built with TypeScript, React, Express, Socket.io, Vite and ChakraUI

## Features

- Real-time messaging: Send and receive messages in real-time in a room
- User handling: Choose a unique username for identification
- Private messaging is currently commented out

## Limitations

- Limited users: A maximum of 10 users can be present in a chat room at a time
- No persistence, so when the server restarts all in-memory messages are lost
